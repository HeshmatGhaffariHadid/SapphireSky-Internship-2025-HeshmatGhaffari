1- What are the different types of errors in Dart?
In Dart programming language we have tow types of erorrs in general:
    - Runtime errors (Exceptions)
      The error occures when the program is executing and caouse the program crash if it is not handled.
    - Compile-time errors (Syntax Errors) 
      The error occures when the code don't follow the programming language syntax, and prevent the progrma compilation
Also there are logical, type, memory, assertion and stack overflow errors 

2- How can you debug a Dart program in VS Code or Android Studio?
At the first we should install Dart and flutter extentions, second we should open a dart file and
start debugging proccess, also we can use print statements to figure out the code outputs or errors.

3- What is the use of print(), and how can it help in debugging?
By running the print statement we can see the variable values or checking which part of the code 
is runable for debugging.

4- Explain the purpose of try...catch in Dart.
We use try...catch to handle runtime exections that occures during the program execuation, when a
program is running without try..catch blocks it crash when an error is found, but if you use try and
catch blocks in the the program the program does not crash and continue to running even it face an error
but throws an exception error message
