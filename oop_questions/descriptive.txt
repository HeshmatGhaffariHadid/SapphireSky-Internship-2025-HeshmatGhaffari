3- How do JavaScript classes differ from traditional classes in languages like Java or C++?
answer: in Dart there is not public, private and protected keywords, therefore all calss elemnts
are public, however if you start an element with (_) it is considered as private. Dart language does

Method overriding is a feature of polymorphism in Dart, it allows a subclass to provide specific 
implementation of a method which is defined in superclass. To override a method just write the
method signature as in the supercalss and provide diferent body for it.

9- What is the purpose of super() in Dart classes?
super() is used to refer the superclass of a subclass, it is used to access the superclass properties,
constructor and methods.

10- Explain the difference between composition and inheritance in Dart.
Inheritance and Composition are two different concepts in programming, and each of them has it's 
own advantages.

- Inheritance: we use it when:
    . A subclass inherites a supercalss properties and behaviors, that show is-a relationship.
    . we need to override the functioanlity
    . we wanna create a hierarchical structure.
- Composition: we use it when:
    . when an object is made of multiple components, that shows has-a relationship.
